<!-- all files in the exercise are related to PNG 550 course. -->
<!-- Benchmark_1_file.in file is implementation of a benchmark in crunchflow -->
<!-- rt.calcite files are related to reactive transport with reaktoro in python -->
<!-- main and mainplot are for plotting crunchflow output files (remmember to choose techplot in crunch flow) -->
<!-- reaktoro is not working correctly because output is GIVING the transport concentration not total concentration in each section -->
